# Portfolio
A portfolio to showcase projects that I have worked on to demonstrate my skills

## Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!
Hi there, my name is Tracey Tran and I am currently a university student double majoring in computer science and statistics. This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects I have completed during my time as a university student. These projects cover a wide range of topics and demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and writing. Each project file consists of the original dataset used, files I created in conducting my analysis, and a project write-up.

## Project 1: Heart Attack Prediction Analysis
This project was an analysis of data on factors that increase the risk of a heart attack. It was done completely in Microsoft Excel and utilizes pivot tables and bar graphs.
