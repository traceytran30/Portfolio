# Portfolio
A portfolio to showcase projects that I have worked on to demonstrate my skills

## Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!
Hi there, my name is Tracey Tran and I am currently a university student double majoring in computer science and statistics. This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects I have completed during my time as a university student. These projects cover a wide range of topics and demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and writing. Each project file consists of the original dataset used, files I created in conducting my analysis, and a project write-up.

## Project 1: Heart Attack Analysis
This project is an analysis of data on factors that increase the risk of a heart attack. It is done completely in Microsoft Excel and utilizes pivot tables and bar graphs.

## Project 2: Diabetes Prediction Analysis
This project is a predictive analysis of data on factors that affect the presence of diabetesin subjects. The analysis is performed using R.
